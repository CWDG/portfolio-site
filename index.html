    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Eric Shtivelberg. I am a recent graduate of the Ohio State University
      with a BS in biochemistry and a BA in Russian language. I also have a minor in
      mathematics. I originally come from the Chicagoland area (<b>CHITOWN REPRESENT!!</b>),
      but have lived in Columbus for the greater part of the last 5 years. I am an avid Chicago
      sports fan as well as a huge fan of the <i>National Champion</i> Buckeyes (in football at
      least). Probably the most interesting fact about me is that I've been to over 40 countries
      around the world (and I plan to go to many more).
